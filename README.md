# Grocery Recipe App Vision Statement

The Grocery Recipe App will be used to help users look for recipes and organize their grocery list.

The app will record users personal information and dietary preferences, and recommend recipes based on popularity as well as users' preferences and search history.

The app will allow users to search for recipes based on names, main ingredients and cuisine. Results of the search can be viewed and filtered with users' dietary preferences in mind. It will display detailed instructions of each recipe, both in text and in videos. It will also allow ratings and entry of comments by users. The list of ingredients from one ore more recipe/s can be added to the user's personal grocery list.

The app will feature the ability to create new recipes.

/// If we have time, can we consider having the feature to plan the meals on a calendar? That way users can add recipes onto the calendar for future meals, and they can add all the ingredients into their grocery lists so that they can buy everything in 1 grocery trip.
///

The app is to be used by profesional chefs as well as home cooks. It will permit chefs to share their recipes and instructions, as well as to monitor the popularity of their recipes and answer other users' questions. Home cooks can search for new recipes and manage the ingredients in their grocery lists for shopping. They can also share their own recipes and give ratings and comments on recipes that they have tried.

The app is initially to be developed as an Android application, but future versions can be created for iOS webapp.

The app will be a significant improvement over the current recipe websites, which only display recipes, and users have to note down ingredients by other means. By having the ability to add ingredients into the grocery list, it provides a one-stop destination for users to look up new recipes and manage their grocery lists for a more streamlined process. ///Maybe talk about the meal planning in calendar thing///

The app will be considered a success based on: /// Need more discussions.
